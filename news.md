As you may know, Scouts have been taking part in initiatives to clean up the environment for some years; weâ€™ve often helped on litter picks to clean up Morpeth as part of the Northumbria in Bloom initiative. We were invited take part in the Greater Morpeth Development Trust (GMDT) led Litter Blitz on Sunday 22nd April 2018. Not only is the town looking a little better, but have helpedstop wildlife being injured or killed by plastic and cans.
