Scouts are the third section of the Scouting movement. From the first experimental camp for 20 boys in 1907, the movement now has an estimated 28 million members worldwide, and in the UK alone there are over 499,000 boys and girls involved in Scouting. An increase in adult volunteers means that more and more young people are now able to take part in their own big adventure.

Scouts offer a wide range of interests from Information Technology, street sports, camping, entertainment, quad biking, yachting and conservation. As well as the outdoor activities, Scouts participate in a balanced programme that helps hem find out about the world they live in, the importance of keeping fit, and knowing their abilities.

Age range: 10Â½ to 14 years old

_On my honour, I promise that I will do my best<br>
To do my duty to God and to the Queen<br>
To help other people<br>
And to keep the Scout Law_

When a Scout reaches 14 they move on to Explorer Scouts.
