#### 26th April 2018

A big thank you to all who took part in Sundayâ€™s litter pick - together with other litter pickers, they collected 60 bags of rubbish and found some interesting items - a hat and a soft toy monkey, amongst other things.

Greater Morpeth Development Trust thanked us for being involved and were impressed with the turnout of Scouts, Cubs and Beavers.  The Scouts behaved really well and were a credit to you.

Litter picks make a real difference to how our town looks and feels so thank you for being involved. We plan to do another in the autumn.
