We always need help in delivering Beavers, Cubs, and Scouts activities. Each of the sections has one Leader in charge, with other adults who assist. All volunteers are DBS checked and Training is given where required. 

What we require from you as a volunteer depends on what you can offer! It could be anything from helping putting up tents to helping work out the finances as part of the Executive Committee. Below are some examples to help you consider whether volunteering with 6th Morpeth Scouts is for you: 

* Assessing badges
* Becoming a trustee to ensure we're spending money correctly
* Catering at camp as part of team
* Demonstrating a new skill at a weekly meeting
* Ensuring continuity by stepping in when a leader can't make it
* Joining the Executive Committee
