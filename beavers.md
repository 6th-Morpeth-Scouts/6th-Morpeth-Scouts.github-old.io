Beaver Scouts are the youngest section of the Scouting family. Their activities are based around making things, outdoor activities, singing, playing games, going out on visits, investigating nature, listening to stories, learning how to be safe and most importantly, making new friends.

Age range:Â 6 to 8 years old

The Beaver Scout promise:

_I promise to do my best,<br>
To be kind and helpful,<br>
and to love God._

When a Beaver reaches the age of 8 they have the opportunity to move on to Cubs.

The Beaver Scout uniform may be purchased from [The Official Scout Shop](http://shop.scouts.org.uk/s-2-beavers.aspx?SectionFilterID=2&sectioncategories=true) or from John Lewis in Newcastle.
