## Privacy notice

As you may already be aware the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the Data Protection Act 1998 from 25th May 2018. It is designed to strengthen the safety and security of all data held within an organisation, and make sure processing and storage procedures are consistent.

6th Morpeth Scouts are committed to safeguarding the privacy of your information and wanted to inform you of what we hold, how we store it and how it is processed.

### The information we may collect and hold
We hold personal data (including sensitive personal data) about members, parents/guardians/carers and volunteers. This may include the following:

* Name and contact details (address, email and phone)
* Age/date of birth
* Details of any health conditions
* Race or ethnic background and native languages
* Religion

### Why do we collect this information?
We collect this information to communicate within the Group and to carry out our responsibilities as Scout Leaders.
For adult volunteers, we have a responsibility to hold information during your membership and afterwards (due to safeguarding responsibilities). This is necessary for the DBS checks which are essential. We also may ask for additional information for attendance at events such as camps.

All adult data relating to membership is held on the Scout Association database – Compass. This system is GDPR compliant.
For members, (Beavers, Cubs and Scouts) we collect personal and sensitive personal data. This data is used at meetings, camps and events to maintain the safety of participants, ensure we can contact parents/carers if we need to, provide activities and diet/facilities which meet individual needs.

All member data is held on a commercial computer system called Online Scout Manager (OSM). The system allows transfer of data between beaver, cubs, scouts and explorer groups as the member progresses in their scouting journey. This system is GDPR compliant.

## Other uses of data
We may use data to:
* Update you about events
* Conduct surveys on our performance
* For financial accounting
* To fundraise for the Scout Group
* To process Gift Aid applications
* Comply with requests from the Scout Association for data in relation to diversity monitoring. (This data is anonymised and numbers only are provided).
* Share with other Scout Groups where required to deliver scouting obligations e.g. stand in Leaders

If we need to use your data outside of normal activities then we will ask for your consent.

### How long do we keep data?
We keep data for varying periods depending upon its use. In general:
* Member data - to make sure of continuity (for example of leavers and then re-joiners) and to carry out our legal responsibilities re safeguarding, we keep membership information throughout the active membership and after it ends.
* Gift Aid forms – it is a requirement that agreement to claim Gift Aid is kept for 7 years after the relevant accounting period.
* Financial information – it is a requirement that financial information e.g. payment of subs is kept for 7 years after the relevant accounting period. We do not hold banking details for anyone.
* Camp/event information – information specifically collected for an event will be kept safely by the Leader until the end of the event and will be destroyed by shredding within 48 hours of the event.
