# Cubs

![Cubs](images/cubs.jpg)

Cubs is the second section of the Scouting movement, originally started in 1916 for younger brothers who wanted a 'look-in'. In nearly a century, the section has constantly evolved and adapted its programme and methods to meet the changing needs of each generation of young people.

Cub Scout you get opportunities to learn and take part in activities like swimming, computing, collecting, sports and exploring. They get badges for doing the activities properly. Cub Scouts will also take part on days out and get the opportunity to go camping and doing lots of outdoor activities.

Age range: 8 to 10½ years old

The Cub Scout promise:

_I promise that I will do my best<br>
To do my duty to God and to the Queen<br>
To help other people<br>
And to keep the Cub Scout Law_

When a Beaver reaches the age of 8 they have the opportunity to move on to Cubs

The Cub Scout uniform may be purchased from [The Official Scout Shop](http://shop.scouts.org.uk/s-3-cubs.aspx?SectionFilterID=3&sectioncategories=true) or from John Lewis in Newcastle.

The word ‘programme’ in Scouting refers to the range of activities, challenges and experiences that young people experience in Scouting.
 
The Scouting programme provides a structure of badges and awards, which are progressive through the sections, and based on a number of objectives. The objectives are based on Scouting’s purpose to "actively engage and support young people in their personal development, empowering them to make a positive contribution to society".

Our programme is based around three main themes: outdoor and adventure, world and skills. This programme of activities is planned by the leadership team in partnership with young people, and should incorporates elements from each theme, to offer young people the most interesting and diverse experience.
